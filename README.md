Most Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) team members of the University of Toronto currently use power pedals — specialized pedals that measure rider power output.
These pedals are inconvenient to install and remove because they aren't needed for every ride.

This project aims to design and build a crank-mounted power meter — a permanent, reliable, and easy-to-use solution that attaches directly to the bike crank.
By moving the power sensing hardware off the pedals, riders can enjoy consistent power data without sacrificing convenience or compatibility with different pedal systems.
